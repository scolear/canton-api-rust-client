The participant server will change it to a unique value each time the corresponding resource is updated. You must not rely on the format of resource version. The participant server might change it without notice. You can obtain the newest resource version value by issuing a read request. You may use it for concurrent change detection by passing it back unmodified in an update request. The participant server will then compare the passed value with the value maintained by the system to determine if any other updates took place since you had read the resource version. Upon a successful update you are guaranteed that no other update took place during your read-modify-write sequence. However, if another update took place during your read-modify-write sequence then your update will fail with an appropriate error. Concurrent change control is optional. It will be applied only if you include a resource version in an update request. When creating a new instance of a resource you must leave the resource version empty. Its value will be populated by the participant server upon successful resource creation. Optional
