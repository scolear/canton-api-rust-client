# ListVettedPackagesRequest

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**package_metadata_filter** | Option<[**models::PackageMetadataFilter**](PackageMetadataFilter.md)> |  | [optional]
**topology_state_filter** | Option<[**models::TopologyStateFilter**](TopologyStateFilter.md)> |  | [optional]
**page_token** | Option<**String**> | Pagination token to determine the specific page to fetch. Using the token guarantees that ``VettedPackages`` on a subsequent page are all greater (``VettedPackages`` are sorted by synchronizer ID then participant ID) than the last ``VettedPackages`` on a previous page.  The server does not store intermediate results between calls chained by a series of page tokens. As a consequence, if new vetted packages are being added and a page is requested twice using the same token, more packages can be returned on the second call.  Leave unspecified (i.e. as empty string) to fetch the first page.  Optional | [optional]
**page_size** | Option<**i32**> | Maximum number of ``VettedPackages`` results to return in a single page.  If the page_size is unspecified (i.e. left as 0), the server will decide the number of results to be returned.  If the page_size exceeds the maximum supported by the server, an error will be returned.  To obtain the server's maximum consult the PackageService descriptor available in the VersionService.  Optional | [optional]
