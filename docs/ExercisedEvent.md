# ExercisedEvent

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**offset** | **i64** | The offset of origin. Offsets are managed by the participant nodes. Transactions can thus NOT be assumed to have the same offsets on different participant nodes. It is a valid absolute offset (positive integer)  Required | 
**node_id** | **i32** | The position of this event in the originating transaction or reassignment. Node IDs are not necessarily equal across participants, as these may see different projections/parts of transactions. Must be valid node ID (non-negative integer)  Required | 
**contract_id** | **String** | The ID of the target contract. Must be a valid LedgerString (as described in ``value.proto``).  Required | 
**template_id** | **String** | Identifies the template that defines the executed choice. This template's package-id may differ from the target contract's package-id if the target contract has been upgraded or downgraded.  The identifier uses the package-id reference format.  Required | 
**interface_id** | Option<**String**> | The interface where the choice is defined, if inherited. If defined, the identifier uses the package-id reference format.  Optional | [optional]
**choice** | **String** | The choice that was exercised on the target contract. Must be a valid NameString (as described in ``value.proto``).  Required | 
**choice_argument** | Option<**serde_json::Value**> | The argument of the exercised choice.  Required | 
**acting_parties** | **Vec<String>** | The parties that exercised the choice. Each element must be a valid PartyIdString (as described in ``value.proto``).  Required: must be non-empty | 
**consuming** | **bool** | If true, the target contract may no longer be exercised.  Required | 
**witness_parties** | **Vec<String>** | The parties that are notified of this event. The witnesses of an exercise node will depend on whether the exercise was consuming or not. If consuming, the witnesses are the union of the stakeholders, the actors and all informees of all the ancestors of this event this participant knows about. If not consuming, the witnesses are the union of the signatories, the actors and all informees of all the ancestors of this event this participant knows about. In both cases the witnesses are limited to the querying parties, or not limited in case anyParty filters are used. Note that the actors might not necessarily be observers and thus stakeholders. This is the case when the controllers of a choice are specified using \"flexible controllers\", using the ``choice ... controller`` syntax, and said controllers are not explicitly marked as observers. Each element must be a valid PartyIdString (as described in ``value.proto``).  Required: must be non-empty | 
**last_descendant_node_id** | **i32** | Specifies the upper boundary of the node ids of the events in the same transaction that appeared as a result of this ``ExercisedEvent``. This allows unambiguous identification of all the members of the subtree rooted at this node. A full subtree can be constructed when all descendant nodes are present in the stream. If nodes are heavily filtered, it is only possible to determine if a node is in a consequent subtree or not.  Required | 
**exercise_result** | Option<**serde_json::Value**> | The result of exercising the choice.  Optional | [optional]
**package_name** | **String** | The package name of the contract.  Required | 
**implemented_interfaces** | Option<**Vec<String>**> | If the event is consuming, the interfaces implemented by the target template that have been matched from the interface filter query. Populated only in case interface filters with include_interface_view set.  The identifier uses the package-id reference format.  Optional: can be empty | [optional]
**acs_delta** | **bool** | Whether this event would be part of respective ACS_DELTA shaped stream, and should therefore considered when tracking contract activeness on the client-side.  Required |
