**offset** | **i64** | The absolute offset. The details of this field are described in ``community/ledger-api/README.md``. Required, it is a valid absolute offset (positive integer). | 
**synchronizer_id** | **String** | A valid synchronizer id. Identifies the synchronizer that synchronized the topology transaction. Required | 
**trace_context** | Option<[**models::TraceContext**](TraceContext.md)> |  | [optional]
**record_time** | **String** | The time at which the changes in the topology transaction become effective.

Topology transactions appear in order relative to a synchronizer based on their effective time rather than their sequencing time. Required |
