# JsTopologyTransaction

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**update_id** | **String** | Assigned by the server. Useful for correlating logs. Must be a valid LedgerString (as described in ``value.proto``).  Required | 
**offset** | **i64** | The absolute offset. The details of this field are described in ``community/ledger-api/README.md``. It is a valid absolute offset (positive integer).  Required | 
**synchronizer_id** | **String** | A valid synchronizer id. Identifies the synchronizer that synchronized the topology transaction.  Required | 
**record_time** | **String** | The time at which the changes in the topology transaction become effective. There is a small delay between a topology transaction being sequenced and the changes it contains becoming effective. Topology transactions appear in order relative to a synchronizer based on their effective time rather than their sequencing time.  Required | 
**events** | [**Vec<models::TopologyEvent>**](TopologyEvent.md) | A non-empty list of topology events.  Required: must be non-empty | 
**trace_context** | Option<[**models::TraceContext**](TraceContext.md)> |  | [optional]
